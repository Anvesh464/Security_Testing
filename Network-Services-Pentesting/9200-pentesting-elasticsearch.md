# 9200 - Pentesting Elasticsearch

## Basic information

Elasticsearch  is a search and analytics engine. As a distributed, JSON-based search and analytics engine, Elasticsearch provides fast search speeds, complex querying, and large-scale data storage capabilities.
Elasticsearch is commonly used to search, analyze, and visualize data with uncertain or complex structures, such as text, numerical data, and time-series data.

**Default port**: 9200/tcp

# Connect
## Connecting to Elasticsearch
```
curl -X GET "<target-ip>:<target-port>"
```
Kibana Interface
You can use tools like Kibana to explore and manage Elasticsearch.

## Recon
### Identifying an Elasticsearch Server
You can determine the presence of an Elasticsearch server using Nmap:
```
nmap -p 9200 X.X.X.X
```
HTTP Banner Grabbing
```
nc -nv X.X.X.X 9200
```
## Enumeration
### Elasticsearch Cluster Information
To get Elasticsearch cluster information, you can use the following command:
```
curl -X GET "<target-ip>:<target-port>/_cluster/health?pretty"
```
Listing Elasticsearch Indices
```
curl -X GET "<target-ip>:<target-port>/_cat/indices?v"
```
### Banner

The protocol used to access Elasticsearch is **HTTP**. When you access it via HTTP you will find some interesting information: `http://10.10.10.115:9200/`

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (294).png>)

If you don't see that response accessing `/` see the following section.

### Authentication

**By default Elasticsearch doesn't have authentication enabled**, so by default you can access everything inside the database without using any credentials.

You can verify that authentication is disabled with a request to:

```bash
curl -X GET "ELASTICSEARCH-SERVER:9200/_xpack/security/user"
{"error":{"root_cause":[{"type":"exception","reason":"Security must be explicitly enabled when using a [basic] license. Enable security by setting [xpack.security.enabled] to [true] in the elasticsearch.yml file and restart the node."}],"type":"exception","reason":"Security must be explicitly enabled when using a [basic] license. Enable security by setting [xpack.security.enabled] to [true] in the elasticsearch.yml file and restart the node."},"status":500}
```

**However**, if you send a request to `/` and receives a response like the following one:

```bash
{"error":{"root_cause":[{"type":"security_exception","reason":"missing authentication credentials for REST request [/]","header":{"WWW-Authenticate":"Basic realm=\"security\" charset=\"UTF-8\""}}],"type":"security_exception","reason":"missing authentication credentials for REST request [/]","header":{"WWW-Authenticate":"Basic realm=\"security\" charset=\"UTF-8\""}},"status":401}
```

That will means that authentication is configured an **you need valid credentials** to obtain any info from elasticserach. Then, you can [**try to bruteforce it**](../generic-hacking/brute-force.md#elasticsearch) (it uses HTTP basic auth, so anything that BF HTTP basic auth can be used).\
Here you have a **list default usernames**: _**elastic** (superuser), remote\_monitoring\_user, beats\_system, logstash\_system, kibana, kibana\_system, apm\_system,_ \_anonymous\_.\_ Older versions of Elasticsearch have the default password **changeme** for this user

```
curl -X GET http://user:password@IP:9200/
```
# Attack Vectors
## Default Credentials
Check for default credentials or weak authentication configurations.

## Unauthorized Access
Search for Elasticsearch targets and gain unauthorized access.

## Data Breach
Gain access to sensitive data by unauthorized access to the Elasticsearch server.

# Post-Exploitation
## Common Elasticsearch Commands

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Command	                                    | Description
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
curl -X GET "<target-ip>:<target-port>"	      | Sends an HTTP GET request to the Elasticsearch server.
curl -X PUT "<target-ip>:<target-port>"	      | Sends an HTTP PUT request to the Elasticsearch server.
curl -X DELETE "<target-ip>:<target-port>"	   | Sends an HTTP DELETE request to the Elasticsearch server.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Basic User Enumeration

```bash
#List all roles on the system:
curl -X GET "ELASTICSEARCH-SERVER:9200/_security/role"

#List all users on the system:
curl -X GET "ELASTICSEARCH-SERVER:9200/_security/user"

#Get more information about the rights of an user:
curl -X GET "ELASTICSEARCH-SERVER:9200/_security/user/<USERNAME>"
```

### Elastic Info

Here are some endpoints that you can **access via GET** to **obtain** some **information** about elasticsearch:

| \_cat                           | /\_cluster                    | /\_security               |

| /\_cat/aliases                  |                               |                           |
| /\_cat/allocation               |                               |                           |

| /\_cat/ml/datafeeds             |                               |                           |
| /\_cat/fielddata                |                               |                           |
| /\_cat/health                   |                               |                           |

These endpoints were [**taken from the documentation**](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/rest-apis.html) where you can **find more**.\
Also, if you access `/_cat` the response will contain the `/_cat/*` endpoints supported by the instance.

In `/_security/user` (if auth enabled) you can see which user has role `superuser`.

### Indices

You can **gather all the indices** accessing `http://10.10.10.115:9200/_cat/indices?v`

```
health status index   uuid                   pri rep docs.count docs.deleted store.size pri.store.size
green  open   .kibana 6tjAYZrgQ5CwwR0g6VOoRg   1   0          1            0        4kb            4kb
yellow open   quotes  ZG2D1IqkQNiNZmi2HRImnQ   5   1        253            0    262.7kb        262.7kb
yellow open   bank    eSVpNfCfREyYoVigNWcrMw   5   1       1000            0    483.2kb        483.2kb
```

To obtain **information about which kind of data is saved inside an index** you can access: `http://host:9200/<index>` from example in this case `http://10.10.10.115:9200/bank`

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (342).png>)

### Dump index

If you want to **dump all the contents** of an index you can access: `http://host:9200/<index>/_search?pretty=true` like `http://10.10.10.115:9200/bank/_search?pretty=true`

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (914).png>)

_Take a moment to compare the contents of the each document (entry) inside the bank index and the fields of this index that we saw in the previous section._

So, at this point you may notice that **there is a field called "total" inside "hits"** that indicates that **1000 documents were found** inside this index but only 10 were retried. This is because **by default there is a limit of 10 documents**.\
But, now that you know that **this index contains 1000 documents**, you can **dump all of them** indicating the number of entries you want to dump in the **`size`** parameter: `http://10.10.10.115:9200/quotes/_search?pretty=true&size=1000`asd\
\&#xNAN;_Note: If you indicate bigger number all the entries will be dumped anyway, for example you could indicate `size=9999` and it will be weird if there were more entries (but you should check)._

### Dump all

In order to dump all you can just go to the **same path as before but without indicating any index**`http://host:9200/_search?pretty=true` like `http://10.10.10.115:9200/_search?pretty=true`\
Remember that in this case the **default limit of 10** results will be applied. You can use the `size` parameter to dump a **bigger amount of results**. Read the previous section for more information.

### Search

If you are looking for some information you can do a **raw search on all the indices** going to `http://host:9200/_search?pretty=true&q=<search_term>` like in `http://10.10.10.115:9200/_search?pretty=true&q=Rockwell`

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (335).png>)

If you want just to **search on an index** you can just **specify** it on the **path**: `http://host:9200/<index>/_search?pretty=true&q=<search_term>`

_Note that the q parameter used to search content **supports regular expressions**_

You can also use something like [https://github.com/misalabs/horuz](https://github.com/misalabs/horuz) to fuzz an elasticsearch service.

### Write permissions

You can check your write permissions trying to create a new document inside a new index running something like the following:

```bash
curl -X POST '10.10.10.115:9200/bookindex/books' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d'
 {
    "bookId" : "A00-3",
    "author" : "Sankaran",
    "publisher" : "Mcgrahill",
    "name" : "how to get a job"
 }'
```

That cmd will create a **new index** called `bookindex` with a document of type `books` that has the attributes "_bookId_", "_author_", "_publisher_" and "_name_"

Notice how the **new index appears now in the list**:

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (130).png>)

And note the **automatically created properties**:

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (434).png>)

## Automatic Enumeration

Some tools will obtain some of the data presented before:

```bash
msf > use auxiliary/scanner/elasticsearch/indices_enum
```
