# 2049 - Pentesting NFS Service

## **Basic Information**

**NFS**  is a protocol that provides shared file system services on a computer network. NFS allows a server to share directories and files, which can then be mounted on client machines over the network.
NFS operates on a server-client model, where the server shares file systems and clients can use these shared files.

**Default port**: 2049/TCP/UDP (except version 4, it just needs TCP or UDP).&#x20;

```
2049/tcp open  nfs     2-3 (RPC #100003
```
## Connection
### Connecting to NFS Shares
Mounting NFS shares is typically done using the mount command. For example:
```
mount -t nfs X.X.X.X:/path/to/share /mnt/nfs
```
This command mounts the share located at /path/to/share on the server with IP address X.X.X.X to the /mnt/nfs directory.
## Listing NFS Shares
The showmount command can be used to list the shares on a server:
```
showmount -e X.X.X.X
```
## Enumeration
Discovering NFS Shares
Tools like `Nmap` can be used to discover NFS shares on a target host. For example:
```
nmap -p 2049 X.X.X.X
```
## Exploiting NFS Shares
Mounting NFS shares can reveal sensitive information and potentially lead to unauthorized access if proper access controls are not in place.

### Versions

- **NFSv2**: This version is recognized for its broad compatibility with various systems, marking its significance with initial operations predominantly over UDP. Being the **oldest** in the series, it laid the groundwork for future developments.

- **NFSv3**: Introduced with an array of enhancements, NFSv3 expanded on its predecessor by supporting variable file sizes and offering improved error reporting mechanisms. Despite its advancements, it faced limitations in full backward compatibility with NFSv2 clients.

- **NFSv4**: A landmark version in the NFS series, NFSv4 brought forth a suite of features designed to modernize file sharing across networks. Notable improvements include the integration of Kerberos for **high security**, the capability to traverse firewalls and operate over the Internet without the need for portmappers, support for Access Control Lists (ACLs), and the introduction of state-based operations. Its performance enhancements and the adoption of a stateful protocol distinguish NFSv4 as a pivotal advancement in network file sharing technologies.

Each version of NFS has been developed with the intent to address the evolving needs of network environments, progressively enhancing security, compatibility, and performance.

## Enumeration

### Useful nmap scripts

```bash
nfs-ls #List NFS exports and check permissions
nfs-showmount #Like showmount -e
nfs-statfs #Disk statistics and info from NFS share
```

### Useful metasploit modules

```bash
scanner/nfs/nfsmount #Scan NFS mounts and list permissions
```

### Mounting

To know **which folder** has the server **available** to mount you an ask it using:

```bash
showmount -e <IP>
```

Then mount it using:

```bash
mount -t nfs [-o vers=2] <ip>:<remote_folder> <local_folder> -o nolock
```

You should specify to **use version 2** because it doesn't have **any** **authentication** or **authorization**.

**Example:**

```bash
mkdir /mnt/new_back
mount -t nfs [-o vers=2] 10.12.0.150:/backup /mnt/new_back -o nolock
```

## Permissions

If you mount a folder which contains **files or folders only accesible by some user** (by **UID**). You can **create** **locally** a user with that **UID** and using that **user** you will be able to **access** the file/folder.

## NSFShell

To easily list, mount and change UID and GID to have access to files you can use [nfsshell](https://github.com/NetDirect/nfsshell).

# Attack Vectors
## Unauthorized Access to NFS Shares
Unauthorized access to NFS shares allows an attacker to access and even modify sensitive data over the network. This poses a significant risk if proper authorization is not enforced.

## Compromising NFS Servers
Compromising an NFS server grants an attacker full access to files on the server. This enables access to sensitive data and can even be used as a pivot point to further compromise other devices on the network.

## NFS Brute Force Attacks
Brute force attacks to gain access to NFS servers are a common tactic. When authorization is weak, attackers can use this method to crack passwords and gain access to the server.

# Post-Exploitation
## Permission on NFS Servers
After a successful breach, attackers can gain full access to files on the server. This provides access to sensitive information and can lead to further targeted attacks or data exfiltration.

## Information Exfiltration
Files on NFS servers often contain sensitive information. After a successful attack, retrieving these files and using the information therein allows attackers to further their goals or leak information.

### Dangerous settings

- **Read and Write Permissions (`rw`):** This setting allows both reading from and writing to the file system. It's essential to consider the implications of granting such broad access.

- **Use of Insecure Ports (`insecure`):** When enabled, this allows the system to utilize ports above 1024. The security of ports above this range can be less stringent, increasing risk.

- **Visibility of Nested File Systems (`nohide`):** This configuration makes directories visible even if another file system is mounted below an exported directory. Each directory requires its own export entry for proper management.

- **Root Files Ownership (`no_root_squash`):** With this setting, files created by the root user maintain their original UID/GID of 0, disregarding the principle of least privilege and potentially granting excessive permissions.

- **Non-Squashing of All Users (`no_all_squash`):** This option ensures that user identities are preserved across the system, which could lead to permission and access control issues if not correctly handled.

Entry_1:
  Name: Notes
  Description: Notes for NFS
  Note: |
    NFS is a system designed for client/server that enables users to seamlessly access files over a network as though these files were located within a local directory. 

    #apt install nfs-common
    showmount 10.10.10.180      ~or~showmount -e 10.10.10.180
    should show you available shares (example /home)

    mount -t nfs -o ver=2 10.10.10.180:/home /mnt/
    cd /mnt
    nano into /etc/passwd and change the uid (probably 1000 or 1001) to match the owner of the files if you are not able to get in
