# 110,995 - Pentesting POP

## Basic Information

**Post Office Protocol (POP)** is a standard protocol for receiving emails. POP3 is a client/server protocol in which email is received and held for you by your Internet server. As this protocol is frequently enabled and poorly configured, it can become a great target.

**Default ports:** 110, 995(ssl)

```
PORT    STATE SERVICE
110/tcp open  pop3
```
# Connect
## Manual Connection
You can use netcat to manually connect to a service:
```
nc <target-ip> 110
```
## Connect Using OpenSSL
You can use OpenSSL to test a secure POP3 connection:
```
openssl s_client -connect <ip>:995
```
### Banner Grabbing

```bash
nc -nv <IP> 110
openssl s_client -connect <IP>:995 -crlf -quiet
```

## Manual

Enumerating a POP3 service can sometimes lead to disclosed sensitive information or poorly configured systems. You can use the command `CAPA` to obtain the capabilities of the POP3 server.

## Automated

```bash
nmap --script "pop3-capabilities or pop3-ntlm-info" -sV -port <PORT> <IP> #All are default scripts
nmap -p 110 --script pop3-ntlm-info <ip>
```
## Attack Vectors
### Bruteforce Attack
You can perform a POP3 bruteforce attack using Nmap
```
nmap -p 110 --script pop3-brute --script-args userdb=users.txt,passdb=pass.txt <ip>
```
Or you also can perform a POP3 bruteforce attack using Hydra
```
hydra -L <user list file> -P <password list file> -f <ip> pop3 -V
```
Post-Exploitation
### Extract Emails

Once logged into a POP3 account, use the RETR command to read emails. This could provide a wealth of information, including sensitive data.
```
RETR 1
```
## Delete Emails
You can use the DELE command to delete a specific email:
```
DELE 1
```
### Check for Credentials

You may find username/password combinations in emails, giving them additional account access.

### Look for Sensitive Data

Users often send sensitive data via email. This data can be personal, financial, or a corporate secret.



The `pop3-ntlm-info` plugin will return some "**sensitive**" data (Windows versions).

### [POP3 bruteforce](../generic-hacking/brute-force.md#pop)

## POP syntax

POP commands examples from [here](http://sunnyoasis.com/services/emailviatelnet.html)

```bash
POP commands:
  USER uid           Log in as "uid"
  PASS password      Substitue "password" for your actual password
  STAT               List number of messages, total mailbox size
  LIST               List messages and sizes
  RETR n             Show message n
  DELE n             Mark message n for deletion
  RSET               Undo any changes
  QUIT               Logout (expunges messages if no RSET)
  TOP msg n          Show first n lines of message number msg
  CAPA               Get capabilities
```

Example:

```
root@kali:~# telnet $ip 110
 +OK beta POP3 server (JAMES POP3 Server 2.3.2) ready 
 USER billydean    
 +OK
 PASS password
 +OK Welcome billydean

 list

 +OK 2 1807

 2 1021

 +OK Message follows

 Dear Billy Dean,

 Here is your login for remote desktop ... try not to forget it this time!
 username: billydean
 password: PA$$W0RD!Z
```

## Logging Passwords

POP servers with the setting **`auth_debug`** enabled will be increasing the logs generated. However, if **`auth_debug_passwords`** or **`auth_verbose_passwords`** are set as **`true`**, password could be also logged in clear text in those logs.

  Name: Notes
  Description: Notes for POP
  Note: |
    Post Office Protocol (POP) is described as a protocol within the realm of computer networking and the Internet, which is utilized for the extraction and retrieval of email from a remote mail server**, making it accessible on the local device. Positioned within the application layer of the OSI model, this protocol enables users to fetch and receive email. The operation of POP clients typically involves establishing a connection to the mail server, downloading all messages, storing these messages locally on the client system, and subsequently removing them from the server. Although there are three iterations of this protocol, POP3 stands out as the most prevalently employed version.
